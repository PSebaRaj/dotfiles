-- Note: done in langsp.lua, the LSP config file
-- As I wanted to change which formatter is used based on which
-- LSP is attached, i.e. prettier for .ts/.tsx/.js/.jsx and plain neoformat (using gopls) on .go, etc

-- vim.keymap.set("n", "F", "<cmd>Neoformat<cr>", { noremap = true, silent = false })
